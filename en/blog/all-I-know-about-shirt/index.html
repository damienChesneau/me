                    <p plang="en" class="lead drop-cap" id="firstp">This post will be built and publish in differents
                        times, the update date will be added with each addition :)</p>

                    
                    <h2 plang="en" class="lead">1- The fabric</h2>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Like for suits, with the shirts fabrics finesse we have the
                        fineness of the yarn which is taken into account for its quality, so we can have a notation like
                        50/1, 80/2, 140/2 the first one qualify the fabric finesse and the second number qualify the
                        number of twists, that is the number of times the thread is twisted on itself.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Because in reality, more the finesse of the thread is high more
                        the shirt will be fragile. So we twist the thread multiple time on itself, tow times for a
                        “double twists” to ensure that this really fine thread will even be durable. There is even the
                        triple twists, on high-end shirts. That gives also a shirt thicker and therefore less
                        transparent.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Of course the higher the numbers are, more the price of the
                        fabric will also be too. The interesting value for a good compromise is around 100/2-120/2.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Poplin: One of the most common fabrics for formal shirts, Its
                        name comes from the papal city of Avignon where the fabric was invented. It can be made of wool,
                        cotton, silk and even polyester. This fabric is totally smooth.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Fil à Fil: This is simply a variation of the poplin with a yarn
                        of different colors to give another shade to the fabrics.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Oxford is thicker than poplin and has a smoother feel. the
                        thread of this fabric is woven two by two. This fabric with two variations the classic and
                        pinpoin the latter is thinner and therefore lighter.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Twill is a fabric easily recognizable by its oblique stripes it
                        is a very simple fabric ironing, which crumples little and also very opaque. The thread is
                        shifted to each row which gives these stripes. There is a declination which is the chevron twill
                        which consists of alternating rows of stripe.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Linen, this is the natural fiber from culture. It is a natural
                        fabric that is a good insulator in the winter and very breathable in the summer. This fabric is
                        rather suitable for hot weather. The disadvantage is only that it creases automatically, so you
                        have to know appreciate this feature and have good ironing skills.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The Giro Inglese is the most interesting fabric when it starts
                        to get hot. Indeed its simple weave, is ventilated which allows the air to pass between. It is a
                        fabric that is rather strong, durable and easy to iron.</p>

                    
                    <h2 plang="en" class="lead">2 - The collar</h2>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Before going into detail of the list of all the existing collars. We will
                        talk about the collar stays. This is a small piece of material that is placed at the tip of the
                        collar so that it stay very rigid and remains very smooth especially on formal shirts. It can be
                        plastic often when you buy it, or we can opt for collar stays in iron or mother of pearl that
                        hold better in time. Depending on the brands or models you can have them already integrated in
                        the collar which allows not to have to deal with it at the time of washing, but in general they
                        are less rigid than if they were removable. In the case of removable collar stays you often have
                        a more rigid collar stays and therefore a smoother collar and especially the ability to change
                        them when they will be worn out or simply to place different types of collar stays (iron, mother
                        of pearl, horn...). The collar stays also allows the collar to remain well tensioned so that it
                        stays perfectly attached to the body and to have no space between them.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The rigidity of the collar is important for formal shirts, this allows
                        the collar to stay upright during the day and not to bend. More triplure we have in the collar
                        more the collar becomes rigid. As on the suits this triplure can be thermobonded, that is to say
                        that glue will be used to fix the fabrics between them and thus go faster during the
                        manufacturing. In the case of a non-thermobonded collar, the different fabrics are woven
                        together. This last technique is more durable over time, the old glue can dissolve and form
                        blisters.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">There is also a shirt finish with the collar all white on a white striped
                        shirt or any other color.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">There are different types of passes, Italian, French, English, American,
                        Club, Cutaway, mid-Cutaway, Napolitan, Officer, Square, Buttoned, Buttoned under paw, Camp,
                        Miami, Classic, Classic tow buttons, Invesed Lucknow, and Broken.
                    </p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">Italian is one of the most common collars for a shirt, it is quite high
                        and wide and can be worn with or without a tie which can be used in any occasion.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">French has a much smaller opening than the Italian. It is a model that
                        remains very classic, but that imposes if a tie is present to have a smaller knot.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The English is a little more specific because it requires the wearing of
                        a tie. It is a collar that has two buttons to lock. A piece of fabric is added above the lowest
                        button. This allows the tie to be a little higher. The width of the collar is calculated to be
                        short enough to have no space with the tie. There is also a variant, with round tips. Less
                        common, a collar called Pin-Collar is of the English type. Instead of having a small piece of
                        fabric to lift the tie, it is a pretty thin and long piece of metal that push the tie upper. It
                        connects both sides of the collar and is closed by small round ends.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The American is also quite special, he has buttons on the points that are
                        also often quite long. It is a very used collar for casual shirts that can be worn with a tie.
                        Buttoned collar also called Washington collar are a little more formal than the classic because
                        his buttons are hidden under the fabric.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The Camp, is a pretty different collar, indeed it is totally flat,
                        without the height of which we are accustomed for a shirt. Here there is no lining, it is made
                        to be flat. It is also made to be placed above the jacket.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">For Miami it can easily be thought that it is only a more relaxed version
                        of the American collar. It&#39;s true that he has the same buttons at the ends of the tips. It only
                        lacks its rigidity and its button which will make it impossible to wear a tie.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The Lucknow is a collar whose two parts of fabric are glued together. It
                        is often a small collar that does not allow to wear a tie. There is a version of it that is
                        reversed that is to say that the two parts of fabric are fully stitched.</p>

                    
                    <p plang="en" class="lead">The broken collar is very formal, with this one impossible to not wear a
                        bowtie. It is quite small with two very small tips that start only on the front of the
                        collar.</p>
